1. It can be difficult to effectively manage shared expenses, particularly when travelling with friends, family, or in a hostel. By creating an intuitive expense-splitting application, our project seeks to streamline this procedure. Users can easily create groups, add expenses, and track dues with the platform's user-friendly interface.

2. Utilised Technologies
The following technologies are used in the construction of our project:

Frontend: HTML and CSS for creating an interface that is both interactive and easy to use.

Backend: Python Flask for managing data, processing expenses, and authenticating users.

Deployment: Render for backend service hosting.

Development Environment: Replit platform for code writing, testing, and execution.

3. Functionality and Features
The following features are offered by the expense-splitting application:
Interface for Users

Replit powers the application, giving users a seamless and convenient platform.

After being greeted by an easy-to-use interface, users can click the "Get Started" button to start using the application.

4.   Verification of Users

Users are taken to the login page after selecting "Get Started."

Users only need to enter their Gmail address and password to log in.

If they are a new user, they can choose to register by entering their information.

5.   Establishing and Managing Groups

Users can create a group and define its purpose after successfully logging in.

In order to manage shared expenses, users can add members to the group.

6.  Expense Management

Users can add an expense within a group.

The added expense can be split equally among all members or customized based on individual contributions.

The system keeps track of all expenses and calculates each participantâ€™s share.

7. Due Tracking and Payment

Each participant can check the app to see if they have any outstanding dues.

Users can pay their dues directly and mark them as settled.

The application provides an option to check dues and confirm payments to ensure transparency and accountability.
